Hi I'm Jay K Delicana.

I'm a Fullstack software developer / engineer passionate in building software applications that solve business needs.
I am skilled in Software design and architecture as well as UI/UX design.

Being a solo developer in my current company, I learned how to create sharepoint databases. Build software applications using Power Apps.
Automate business processes using Power Automate. Deploy these applications in Microsoft Teams.
I also learned Test Driven Development (TDD) to iron out bugs during development.

I love technology that improve our lives.
My hobbies are computer games and board games.
